# ImageOnMap

## OVERVIEW

Have you ever wanted to view an image on an ingame map? ImageOnMap provides just that. ImageOnMap allows you to load a picture from the Internet to a Minecraft map.

## PLUGIN

### ToMap Command

First, make sure you have a free inventory slot, as the plugin will give you a map. The main command we will be using is **/tomap** . You can resize the maps by adding the width and height after the keyword resize, for example **/tomap url resize 2 4**. You can also change the scaling method by replacing the resize keyword to **resize-stretched** to stretch the image to the surface _\(the image may be distorted\)_, or **resize-covered** to to ensure the image covers the whole surface _\(the image will never be distorted, but some parts may be lost near the borders\)_. The permission node for this is **imageonmap.new**.

### Maps Command:

**/map**s is another command which opens a GUI to see, retrieve and manage user's maps. You can retrieve any created maps, or manage created maps. Maps can be renamed \(for organization\), deleted \(but they won't render ingame anymore!\), or partially retrieved \(for posters maps containing more than one map\). Permission: **imageonmap.list**, **imageonmap.get**, **imageonmap.rename** and **imageonmap.delete** for actions into the GUI.
