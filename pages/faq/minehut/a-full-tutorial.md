# Full Tutorial

## Chapter 1: Getting an account.

First, head over to the [Minehut Homepage](https://minehut.com/) and click LOGIN at the top left, if you already have an account, you'll probably already be logged in. Click Sign Up, enter in the requested details, and click Sign Up. You'll be sent an email verification, accept that, then revisit the page. If you already have an account, enter in your details and login.

## Chapter 2: Making your server.

Once you have made your account, you will need to make your server. You'll want to visit the Create page, which can be found [here](https://minehut.com/dashboard/create). Now enter a server name, you need to have more than 4 characters, but less than 10. If you try to create a server and it doesn't work, the name is probably taken \(sometimes the error message doesn't show up\).

## Chapter 3: Activating your server.

Every time you, or someone, wants to join your server, it will need to be activated \(if it's offline\). There are two ways of doing this, 1\) go to the [Panel](https://minehut.com/dashboard) and click Activate Server. 2\) Join the Minehut Lobby \(mc.minehut.com\), and use /join \[server name\]. If you've used the panel to start up your server, it will bring you to the main dashboard of your server. This is where you can run console commands, install plugins, and many more things.

## Chapter 4: Installing plugins.

Any plugin on anywhere is usable on minehut. Grab a jar from [spigot](https://spigotmc.org) and drag and drop it into the file manager `/plugins` folder!
If you cant find a jar you like on spigot, you can look at the `Addons` page which can be found at the top of the page. You need to own the addon.
You can search for addons with the search bar, there is a wierd bug right now that makes it so you cant search until it has loaded some. If you 
still can't find one your looking for, check the marketplace!

## Chapter 5: Server Plans.

Minehut servers are free, unless you want to upgrade your server to allow for more players, plugins and ram. A higher server plan is useful if you're planning on making a public server. You can view a list of server plans [here](https://minehut.com/shop/plans).
