# Installing Plugins

## INSTALLING PLUGINS

Head over to [SpigotMC](https://spigotmc.org) and find a plugin you would like to install. Download that jar, and upload it to the **File Manager** /plugins directory.

## UNINSTALLING PLUGINS

Go to the **File Manager**, then the directory /plugins. Find the **JAR file** of the plugin you would like to remove. Delete that file and the folder of the plugin.

## RESETTING PLUGIN CONFIGURATIONS

Go to the **File Manager**, then the directory /plugins. Find the **folder** of the plugin you would like to reset. Delete that folder.

## RESTARTING YOUR SERVER

Now, restart your server, and all the changes you've made will take effect.
