# How to get the `mods` folder
First, make a **backup** of your server. If something fails, you want to have a fallback. Then, we can go ahead and start with the server, Head over to the **Settings** tab of your [Minehut Panel](https://minehut.com/login), then set the `Server Type` to either `SpongeForge` or `Fabric`. Then select the supported version you would like to install. Restart the server, and you got yourself a modded server!

<Hint severity="warning">NOTE: It is recommended to have a server plan of at least MH35 to run mods.</Hint>

# How to Upload Mods
Head over to your [Minehut Dashboard](https://minehut.com/login) and click on the server you would like to upload mods to. Click the **File Manager** option, and head over to the `mods` folder. Then you can click the upload button and upload the mods you want! Then Restart the server and enjoy your mods :)
